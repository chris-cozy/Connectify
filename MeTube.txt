Git Basics
The command git status checks in on the status of your repository
To make a commit/checkpoint, there are two steps
	- Choose which files to add to the staging area
		○ git add <file name(s)>
		○ git add .
			§ Adds all changes into staging area
	- Commit the changes
		○ git commit -m "Commit message"
			§ The string is associated with the commit, should explain what was changed/committed
			§ The -m is the extension that allows the addition of a message
    - Push the changes to the repository
        - git push -u origin main
