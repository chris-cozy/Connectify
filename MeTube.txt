PLAN (What we need):
---Enable keyword Search
    SELECT 4 FROM media WHERE keyword="input" AND type=".mp4"

In the subscriptions page, display the 4 most recently uploaded media from anyone in their friends list
    This one will be slightly more complicated. Will need to first select all of the user's friends, then append that list to media and sort to find their most recent videos
Make an array containing all of the userID's of the current user's friends
Select 4 recent medias from the media table who's userID's are present in the array

On the playlist page, display a list of their playlists.  Clicking on a playlist name will navigate to the playlist media page
